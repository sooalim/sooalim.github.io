## Executive Summary

### Project Overview
This document outlines the technical design for a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agent implementation using Microsoft Azure services and Copilot Studio. The solution will enable intelligent information retrieval and response generation based on organizational knowledge bases.

### Key Design Decisions
- **Azure-Native Architecture**: Leveraging Azure PaaS services for scalability and management
- **Microservices Approach**: Decomposed into loosely coupled services
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Asynchronous processing for better performance
- **Vector-Based Search**: Using Azure Cognitive Search for semantic search capabilities
- **Container-Based Deployment**: Using Azure Container Instances and Functions

### Success Metrics
- Query response time < 5 seconds (95th percentile)
- System availability > 99.5%
- Support for 100+ concurrent users
- Data freshness within 24 hours
